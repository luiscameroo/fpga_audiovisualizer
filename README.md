ECE241 - Digital Systems - Final Project

Finite State Machine, cycles through gathering digital signal of audio, processing the signal 
a filter to determine amplitude of frequencies, and dsiplaying the eight different amplitudes. 
Using a VGA Controller display the amplitude of a select bandwith of frequencies by implementing
an FIR filter using a shift register. The FIR filters coefficients where calculated using Matlab.
